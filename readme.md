## Project Earthworm

Indian farmers are highly distressed about outstanding bank loans piling up due to successive
crop failures. Adverse climatic conditions, unpredictable weather, short of rainfall, pests and
diseases, poor farming practices or neglect by farmers can end up in crop failures and cause
immense loss to farmers. Every year, Government of India spends a vast sum of money to
waive off these loans.

Project Earthworm aims to come up with a solution that can save farmers from inescapable debt and also help the Government of India save a huge amount of money every
year. In the urban cities, the people have a feeling of compassion for the farmers who work so
hard and still lead such unfair lives. Our solution is to make a portal that will allow any person
to provide these farmers with monetary help. The sponsor in return gets an incentive in the
form of organic produce. The farmers can crowdsource their expense and need not opt for a
bank loan.

If the harvest is successful, then the farmer, as a loan obligation, gives a chunk of the
produce to the sponsor, who gets an unadulterated farm fresh organic supply of the crop. Given
that the demand for farm fresh organic supply is ever rising in the cities, the sponsor gets a
trustworthy source of organic supply at a fraction of the price charged by big brands in the
name of organic food.

If the harvest fails, the farmer has no obligation towards the sponsor. This helps the
farmer to remain debt free and the sponsor has saved the farmer from going into debt.
